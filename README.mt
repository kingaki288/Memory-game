Hello!
My name is Kinga.
My dream is to start my news live path as a programmer.
 I code for a really short time.
 I started two weeks ago in C++. 
When I saw your advertisement for Java Bootcamp I decided to at least give it a tryâ€¦
In two days I learned as much as possible to do my best at your assignment and here we are :).Maybe it's not the best, but it's the first one in this language for me. I am terribly sorry for the quality of language but I didn't have enough time to properly do it. I also had a big project at my current job, but if It will even be possible to get to your Bootcamp I'm ready to quit it and fully commit to this path. I also would like you to please give it a chance and write me back. It will really help me to improve myself!
